                    <h3>Corporate Office</h3>
          </header>
Founded in 2010 by James Ferreira, New England's Purest began as a small family-owned business with a singular mission: to provide the cleanest, purest water available to customers throughout New England. James, inspired by the pristine lakes and natural springs of the region, saw an opportunity to ensure that the water people consumed was free from contaminants while preserving the natural beauty of the area's waterways.In the early days, the company focused on small-scale local distribution, serving homes, businesses, and local events. However, as demand for cleaner, more sustainable water options grew, so did the company. Over the years, New England's Purest expanded its operations, incorporating eco-friendly practices like BPA-free bottles and expanding into larger regional markets.
Today, New England's Purest has grown into one of the leading providers of purified water in the Northeast, offering a variety of water-related products, from large-volume dispensers to eco-friendly water bottles. Under James Ferreira's leadership, the company remains committed to its founding principles: providing fresh, clean water while supporting the health of the region's lakes and natural environments.
