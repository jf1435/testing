          </header>
Founded in 2010 by James Ferreira, New England's Purest began as a small family owned business with a one mission, to provide the cleanest, purest water available to customers throughout New England. In the early days, the company focused on local distribution, serving homes, businesses, and local events. However, as demand for cleaner, more healthy water options grew, so did the company. Over the years, New England's Purest expanded its foundation, including eco friendly things like BPA free bottles and expanding into larger regional markets.
Today, New England's Purest has grown into one of the leading providers of purified water in the Northeast, offering different water related products, from dispensers to eco friendly water bottles. Under James Ferreira's leadership, the company remains committed to its founding goals. Providing fresh clean water while supporting the health of the areas lakes and environment.
